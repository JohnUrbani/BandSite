        <h2>The Beatles: The Beatles Review</h2>
        <h3>By Robert Ham</h3>

        <p>For some folks—even some of the people that had a hand in making it—The Beatles, a.k.a. The White Album, is far too long, far too jumbled for its own good. In the 50 years since its original release, fans the world over have attempted to boil down the two disc, 30 song sprawl into a tight, single LP. Even today, rock critics Steven Hyden and Rob Mitchum have, on the Celebration Rock podcast, put together their dream version: a 12-track album that even swaps out the well-known renditions of songs on the original release with alternate takes and other songs from the era.</p>
        <p>What must all of those folks make of the recent re-release of The Beatles, particularly in its super-deluxe form: six CDs and one Blu-ray, gathering together everything from the demos the group recorded at George Harrison’s pad in Esher before entering the studio to copious studio outtakes? And, of course, a remastered, remixed version of the...</p>

        <h2>The Definitive Ranking Of All The Songs On The Beatles’ ‘White Album’</h2>
        <h3>By Barry Lenser</h3>

        <p>“The White Album” may not be the Beatles’ best record, but it is their record that’s the most fun to sift through, break down, and talk about. As Samuel Buntz noted in these pages, it was recently the album’s 50th anniversary. That always means retrospectives, reassessments, and appreciations galore. So, how about another one? How about a ranking of all 30 songs from the album?</p>
        <p>The main objection to such an enterprise would be that doing so violates the spirit of “The White Album.” Because sequencing is so key to the record’s artistry and appeal, assessing all of the tracks out of context could do a disservice to some of them. It might not take into consideration the full function of a particular song...</p>

        <p>Richard Hamilton’s cover for the eponymous 1968 double album by the Beatles, which was 50 years old on 22 November, achieved a rare feat. As Andrew Wilson, the senior curator of Modern and contemporary art at Tate Britain, says on the latest episode of The Art Newspaper podcast: “I can’t think of many other records where the title that people give them is actually a description of the design for the cover.” That title is, of course, the White Album.</p>
        <p>The podcast looks in detail at Hamilton’s design, but also at the connection between the Beatles and the art world in that period, particularly through Paul McCartney’s connection with the...</p>
